# Notes:

-this code is supposed to be for a minecraft opencomputers turtle, where the turtle has level-3 specifications, inventory upgrade, max flight upgrade, etc.

# How it works:

>This bot must start at the bottom right of where it wants to mine. The bot must also have a pickaxe. If the bot does not have a pickaxe, it'lll likely stop after some time because the bot will run out of battery. The chest must be placed right under where the bot started, and an energy cell must be placed right behind where the bot started.

>The bot will ask you the dimensions of the space you want to mine. That means, it will go for x amount of spaces forward, y amount of spaces to the left, and z amount of spaces upwards. For example, if x=3, y=3, z=1, the bot will mind:
x x x 
x x x
x x x
    o
    
    where o is the location of the bot.
